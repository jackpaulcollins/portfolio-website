        <p>I have done all sorts of different things, and work throughout my days. I've worked in customer service, labor, office management, and fast food. Currently I deliver pizzas for Dominos while I am attending Epicodus. In the summer I clean windows for a company I started called First Impression Window Cleaning. Before making that change I worked three years as the office manager/move coordinator for 2 Brothers moving in Portland, OR.</p>

        <p>I have been interested in technology since I was a young kid. I built my first computer when I was fifteen. It had 512MB of RAM, and a Pentium 4 processor. I've been studying programming since late 2018, and have experience with Python, HTML, CSS, Linux, MAC OS, and Windows. </p>
